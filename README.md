# RComplexas2016
Projecto

This project was developed in Python, under the OS Ubuntu.

In order to run our project you must have installed the following libraries:
NetworkX, matplotlib, random, numpy.

By installing NetworkX through pip (in terminal insert: pip install networkX) you can simulate our experiments. Some of our group members intalled NetworkX using other methods(the source code on Git) and weren't able to run the project.

By default, our simulation is using the startRandomInfection() function (line 230). If you wish to simulate using a targeted infection just comment the line 230 and uncomment the line 231. 

To run the project, download the source code, go to the directory containing the code, open a terminal window and insert:
python factory.py

Then you will have to insert which model you want to simulate, and how many nodes you want the simulation to have.

You will see a plot on your screen and the corresponding threshold.

Enjoy!

The file contains code from the first delivery and the second delivery. There are methods used in the first delivery that were only used to test the graphs. All the methods used are defined and have a brief description.

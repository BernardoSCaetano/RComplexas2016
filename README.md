# RComplexas2016
Projecto

This project was developed in Python, under the OS Ubuntu.

In order to run our project you must have installed the following libraries:
NetworkX 
matplotlib
random 
numpy

By installing NetworkX trough pip you can simulate our experiments. Some of our group members intalled NetworkX using other methods and weren't able to run the project.

To run the project, download the source code, go to the directory containing the code and insert:
python factory.py

Then you will have to insert wich model u want to simulate, and how many nodes you want the simulation to have.

You will see a plot on your screen and the corresponding threshold.

Enjoy!
